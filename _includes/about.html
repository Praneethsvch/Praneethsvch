                <h2>Hola! </h2>
            <p>
                My name is Praneeth. I graduated from NYU Tandon School of Engineering in 2021 with a Master's degree in Computer Engineering. I've been working as an Embedded Engineer for <a href="https://www.floodnet.nyc/">FloodNet</a>, a NYC DEP, NYC DOT, and an ESD-funded research project at NYU.
                <br>
                <br>
               FloodNet project is a collaboration between research teams and various city agencies aiming to develop flood-monitoring solutions in flood-prone areas in NYC. These low-cost sensors are first of its kind to use a novel ultrasound ranging technology to capture depths with high accuracies. AtÂ FloodNet, I am responsible for hardware and software sensing solutions for a city-wide network of advanced IoT sensors. In developing these solutions, I gained skills in embedded systems design, firmware development, testing, and troubleshooting. After over a year of successful prototyping and collaboration with city agencies, educational institutions, and research scientists, I am currently accelerating the Design for Manufacturing (DFM) process for manufacturability and scale-up.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am actively looking for the next exciting embedded challenge, and would love to connect with you.
