                <h2>Hola! </h2>
            <p>
                My name is Praneeth. I am a recent graduate of NYU Tandon School of Engineering with a Master's degree in Computer Engineering. I've been working as an Embedded Sensors Engineer for <a href="https://www.floodnet.nyc/">FloodNet</a>, a USDOT and ESD-funded research project at NYU.
                <br>
                <br>
                My passion for building and designing systems has led me to develop sensor solutions to tackle urban flooding in New York City. In developing these solutions, I gained skills in embedded systems design, firmware development, testing, and troubleshooting. After over a year of successful prototyping and collaboration with city agencies, educational institutions, and research scientists, I am currently accelerating the FloodNet project from the prototyping stage to the production stage.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am actively looking for the next exciting embedded challenge, and would love to connect with you.
