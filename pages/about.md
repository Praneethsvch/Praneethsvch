# Hola!

I am a recent graduate at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, where I gained experience and skills in designing and developing embedded systems. As an Embedded Sensor Engineer at [FloodNet](http://floodnet.nyc/), I have been developing hardware and software for advanced IoT sensors to monitor urban flooding.

My research and career interests lie in Embedded systems design and Internet of Things.
