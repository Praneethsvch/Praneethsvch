				<h2>Hola! </h2>
            <p>
                My name is Praneeth. I am a recent graduate of NYU Tandon School of Engineering with a 		Master's degree in Computer Engineering. I've been working as an Embedded Sensors Engineer for FloodNet, a USDOT and ESD funded research project at NYU. 
                <br>
				<br>
				My passion for building and designing systems has led me to develop sensor solutions to tackle the problems of urban flooding in New York City. In developing these solutions, I gained skills in embedded systems design, firmware development, testing and troubleshooting. After over an year of prototyping and collabortion with city agencies, educational institutions, and research scientists, currently I am working towards accelerating the FloodNet project from prototyping stage to the production stage.
